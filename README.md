# William Lee's Hero Digital Take Home Assessment 

Given the requirements and the time frame allotted, this form is what I was able to come up with. 

## Directions
You can clone the repo, cd into it, and then run npm install into npm start. 
This should open up your localhost:3000 port on your browser and showcase the form that I made. 



## Future Improvements
 - Styling the dropdown. Ran out of time to change the styling of the dropdown so had to leave it as the default value. 
 - Incorporate a more eloquent of going from submit to the success message. I would have added auntheticated routes to create a better route to the success message on top of user authentication. 
 - POST API simply revolves around a Promise. Maybe better POST handling with URI encoding instead of manually writing my own encoder.
